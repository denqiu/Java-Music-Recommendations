# Java-Music-Recommendations
# Uses a custom-made algorithm called Brute Force -- [Algorithm](https://github.com/dwq9172/Java-Music-Recommendations/blob/master/BruteForce.java), [Output](https://github.com/dwq9172/Java-Music-Recommendations/blob/master/BruteForce.txt) -- to show a set number of songs that an user may like based on the characteristics of a song they listened to
# A group project from my CSC380 course, Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Uses a [text file](https://github.com/dwq9172/Java-Music-Recommendations/blob/master/Music_Database_Blake.txt) to keep track of songs and their characteristics. 
# Using TreeMaps, groups songs into categories based on song name, artist, genre, and other characteristics, i.e., happy song, classical, rap song, just to name a few examples.
# Searches for songs with the most common characteristics, given by a “fake”, or generated, user
# Songs found are sorted by popularity of characteristics and cuts off the less popular songs to create for example, top 10 songs or top 20 songs the generated user may like.
# Uses a custom-made GUI and Selenium WebDriver to search for songs from SoundCloud.
